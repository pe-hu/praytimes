  <p><u>4月5日のプレイタイムズ</u></p>
  <p>
    5th April. The first sunday of a month is our “プレイタイムズ" day.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was sunny and was truly a spring day. I felt good with smooth breeze and plants looked fresh.
    <br>We gathered on Hangout at 11a.m to watch flowers in each places. Display was filled with colorful flowers. We all welcomed and enjoyed spring even in this sad and serious situation.
    <br>I was glad with not only being happy and also I could see everyone looked happy.
    <br>We looked forward to watching this Hangout archive we recorded and wanted to enjoy it.
    <br>I believe it would be such a nice visual.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I made a big mistake..
    <br>I recorded only 10 minutes of first part.
    <br>My first dearest pc of my life... it can't record Hangout without the internet.. I brought my wifi out of my house without thinking nothing.
    <br>Oh my goodness.. how stupid..
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm so sad I won't be able to watch that video..
    <br>But what we did wasn't a special things and was our daily lives, so we can do the same thing again and again.
    <br>That's not what a person who made a mistake can say though.
