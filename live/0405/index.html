5th April. The first sunday of a month is our "プレイタイムズ" day.<br>
<br>
It was sunny and was truly a spring day. I felt good with smooth breeze and plants looked fresh.<br>
We gathered on Hangout at 11a.m to watch flowers in each places. Display was filled with colorful flowers.<br>
We all welcomed and enjoyed spring even in this sad and serious situation.<br>
I was glad with not only being happy and also I could see everyone looked happy.<br>
We looked forward to watching this Hangout archive we recorded and wanted to enjoy it.
I believe it would be such a nice visual.<br>
<br>
However, I made a big mistake..
I recorded only 10 minutes of first part.<br>
My first dearest pc of my life... it can't record Hangout without the internet..<br>
I brought my wifi out of my house without thinking nothing. Oh my goodness.. how stupid..<br>
<br>
I'm so sad I won't be able to watch that video..<br>
But what we did wasn't a special things and was our daily lives, so we can do the same thing again and again.<br>
That's not what a person who made a mistake can say though.
