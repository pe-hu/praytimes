5th April. The first sunday of a month is our "プレイタイムズ" day.

It was sunny and was truly a spring day. I felt good with smooth breeze and plants looked fresh.
We gathered on Hangout at 11a.m to watch flowers in each places. Display was filled with colorful flowers. We all welcomed and enjoyed spring even in this sad and serious situation.
I was glad with not only being happy and also I could see everyone looked happy.
We looked forward to watching this Hangout archive we recorded and wanted to enjoy it. I believe it would be such a nice visual.

However, I made a big mistake..
I recorded only 10 minutes of first part.
My first dearest pc of my life... it can't record Hangout without the internet..
I brought my wifi out of my house without thinking nothing. Oh my goodness.. how stupid..

I'm so sad I won't be able to watch that video..
But what we did wasn't a special things and was our daily lives, so we can do the same thing again and again.
That's not what a person who made a mistake can say though.
